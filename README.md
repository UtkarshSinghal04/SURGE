The disruptive impacts of climate change have created an urgent need to transition to a low carbon economy and an important part of this transition is an increase in the usage of clean energy. The greater adoption of clean energy is creating new opportunities for clean energy equity investing. The existing literature mostly focuses on the dynamic relationship between clean energy equities, oil prices, technology stock prices, and other important macroeconomic variables like market volatility and economic policy uncertainty. However, there is a shortage of literature on forecasting clean energy stock prices. Forecasting clean energy equity prices is important for making investment decisions. This paper uses machine learning methods to predict the clean energy stock prices. Initially the main motive of the project was just to predict the direction of the clean energy stock prices , but I used a regressor model thinking that even if it has some loss, it will still tell us direction with high precision
