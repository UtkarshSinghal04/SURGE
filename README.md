The disruptive impacts of climate change have created an urgent need to transition to a low-carbon economy, with a significant part of this transition involving the increased use of clean energy. This greater adoption of clean energy is opening up new opportunities for clean energy equity investing.

Existing literature primarily focuses on the dynamic relationships between clean energy equities, oil prices, technology stock prices, and other critical macroeconomic variables such as market volatility and economic policy uncertainty. However, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the forecasting of clean energy stock prices, which is crucial for making informed investment decisions.

This paper aims to address this gap by employing machine learning methods to predict clean energy stock prices. Initially, the primary objective of the project was to predict the direction of clean energy stock prices. However, I chose to use a regressor model, reasoning that even if there were some loss, the model would still provide high-precision directional forecasts.
